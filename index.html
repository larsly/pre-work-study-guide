        <h2>HTML</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>When building a website first we use HTML to build a sturdy frame</li>
          <li>The head element contains information about the webpage.</li>
          <li>The body element represents the visible content shown to the user.</li>

        <h2>CSS</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>programming language used by developers to define how webpage content is presented to users</li>
          <li>CSS defines the colors, aesthetics, visual layout, and organization</li>
          <li>internal style sheet contains CSS rules for the webpage in the head section of the HTML file</li>
          <li>the most common way to style a webpage is by using an external CSS style sheet. 
          This is preferred in most cases because it allows developers to keep all their CSS rules in a separate file, which makes design changes easier</li>
          <li>When a developer wants to style an element directly in the HTML file, they use inline CSS. 
          Inline styles apply to a specific HTML tag, using a style attribute with a CSS rule to style a particular page element only</li>
          <li>margin property indicates how much space outside of an element</li>
          <li>padding property adds space around the content inside an element</li>
          <li>Don't forget to link your style sheet in the head section where we store metadata</li>
          <li>Class attributes allow us to share a CSS rule to any element we choose by assigning the rule to a class attribute with a class selector</li>

        <h2>JavaScript</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>JavaScript (JS) is a high-level dynamic programming language that allows users to interact with websites. 
          Using JavaScript, you can power your websites with effects, interactivity, data communication, and much more</li>
          <li>a variable is simply a named container that allows us to store data in our code</li>
          <li>console.log prints to your terminal output.</li>
          <li>Terminal acts as a command center</li>
          <li>There is a console in your web browser that lets you run JavaScript</li>
          <li>syntax error means there is a character thats not supposed to be there</li>
          <li>Control flow is the order in which a computer executes code in a script</li>
          <li>A function is simply **a “chunk” of code that you can use over and over again, rather than writing it out multiple times. 
          Functions enable programmers to break down or decompose a problem into smaller chunks, each of which performs a particular task</li>
